.SH "NAME"
.PP
cfgroup - list or query CFEngine configuration

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
cfgroup  \fI[OPTION]\fP... \fI[GROUP]\fP...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Cfgroup will list or query CFengine configuration details. Note this is an internal tool that may
or may not be of use to you.

.PP
Cfgroup lists hostnames that are part of specified groups. Data sources are group.cf,
functionals.cf and  promises.cf. If \fIGROUP\fPs are given on the command line the members
of those groups are printed.

.PP
For finding those files the following algorithm is used:

.IP \(bu 4
if the cwd is inside a git repository and the basename is called 'cfengine' it will use the files from
the current git repository.
.IP \(bu 4
if the cwd is not in a cfengine git repository \fBcfgroup\fP will try /var/cfengine.
.IP \(bu 4
if \fB\fC-i\fR is specified, use \fIthose\fP files.


.PP
Options are:

.TP
\fB\fC-i\fR \fIFILE\fP[,\fIFILE\fP]...
A single \fIFILE\fP or a comma seperated list of \fIFILE\fP,\fIFILE\fP that should be used as input, typically
used for testing, but also useful to force cfgroup to parse a specific set of files.
.TP
\fB\fC-l\fR
print all groups to standard output.
.TP
\fB\fC-r\fR \fIHOST\fP
reverse lookup, show the classes for this specific host.
.TP
\fB\fC-x\fR \fIGROUP\fP
list the hostnames from all specified \fIGROUP\fPs that are \fInot also\fP in this specific \fIGROUP\fP. Mostly
used to filter out "IsInactive" hosts: \fB\fCcfgroup -x IsInactive IsWebserver\fR as an example.
.TP
\fB\fC-o\fR
list the hostnames that only appear \fIonce\fP in the specified \fIGROUP\fPs.
.TP
\fB\fC-n\fR
list the hostnames that only appear \fImore than once\fP in the specified \fIGROUP\fPs, i.e. the
opposite of \fB\fC-o\fR.
.TP
\fB\fC-d\fR
enable debug logging.
